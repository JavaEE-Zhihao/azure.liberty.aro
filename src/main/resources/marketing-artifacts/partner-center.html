<p>This offer automatically provisions several Azure resources to quickly move to IBM WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO). The provisioned resources include virtual networks, an ARO cluster, along with the OpenShift Container Registry (OCR), and the Liberty Operator. A secure OpenShift namespace is set up to contain your application. The offer can also deploy Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty Container (e.g., Docker) images. After initial provisioning, you can focus on deploying your Liberty application to ARO.</p>
<p>ARO requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. Please ensure your subscription has sufficient quota.</p>
<p>This offer is Bring-Your-Own-License, and assumes you have sufficient entitlements. WebSphere Liberty is available as a limited Trial option before entitlement is required. Open Liberty is open source and free to use unsupported. You can also use Open Liberty supported through WebSphere Liberty entitlements. When using WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty supported, usage should be tracked using the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/ibm-licensing-operator">License Service Operator</a>. </p>
<p>IBM and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step guidance on getting started with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift/howto-deploy-java-liberty-app">Liberty and ARO</a>. The guidance is suitable for customers that wish to remain as close as possible to a native OpenShift manual provisioning experience instead of using the offer.</p>
