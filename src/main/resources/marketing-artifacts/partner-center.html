<p>Run IBM WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift</p>
<h1>Short description</h1>
<p>Run IBM WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) leveraging the Liberty Operator.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Part of the WebSphere family of products, WebSphere Liberty and Open Liberty are next generation Java platforms and
are important to cloud modernization of mission critical enterprise Java workloads. Open Liberty is the production-ready,
open-source base for WebSphere Liberty. Sharing the same core implementation, both offerings are fast, lightweight, modular, and
container-friendly cloud native runtimes with robust support for industry standards such as Java EE, Jakarta EE, and MicroProfile.</p>
<p>This solution automates most boilerplate steps to provision WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)
cluster. Once initial provisioning is complete, you are completely free to customize deployments further. The solution is jointly
developed by IBM and Microsoft.</p>
<p>The following resources are automatically provisioned by the offer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ARO cluster (alternatively, you can deploy to an existing ARO cluster)</li>
  <li>OpenShift Container Registry (OCR) enabled</li>
  <li>Liberty Operator</li>
  <li>Secure OpenShift namespace to contain your application</li>
  <li>Sample getting started application - optional</li>
  <li>Custom application deployment - optional</li>
  <li>Virtual network and two subnets</li>
</ul>
<p>ARO requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. Please ensure your subscription has sufficient quota.</p>
<p>This offer is Bring-Your-Own-License, and assumes you have sufficient entitlements. WebSphere Liberty is available as a limited
Trial option before entitlement is required. Open Liberty is open source and free to use unsupported. You can also use OpenLiberty
supported through WebSphere Liberty entitlements. When using WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty supported, usage should be tracked
using the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/ibm-licensing-operator">License Service Operator</a>.</p>
<p>IBM and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step instructions on getting started with Liberty and ARO without automated
provisioning.</p>
<p>IBM and Microsoft provide similar solutions targeting WebSphere (traditional) on Azure VMs (single instance or cluster),
and Liberty on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). These options are linked in the <i>Learn more</i> section below.</p>
